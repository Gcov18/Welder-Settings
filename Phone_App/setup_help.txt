Step-by-step setup instructions:

To check if you have Node.js installed, open a terminal or command prompt and run:
    node --version
If you see a version number (e.g., v18.17.0), Node.js is installed.
If you get an error or no version, download and install Node.js from https://nodejs.org/

1. Install Node.js from https://nodejs.org/ if you don't have it already.
2. Install Expo CLI globally (recommended for beginners):
    npm install -g expo-cli
3. Create a new Expo project (if you haven't):
    npx create-expo-app welder-settings
    cd welder-settings
4. Copy this App.tsx file into your project's folder (replace the default App.js or App.tsx).
5. Install the required dependencies:
    npx expo install react-native @react-native-picker/picker
6. Start the Expo development server:
    npx expo start
7. Download the Expo Go app on your iOS or Android device from the App Store or Google Play.
8. Scan the QR code shown in your terminal or browser with Expo Go to run the app on your phone.

Troubleshooting (Windows):
If you see an error like:
    "npm.ps1 cannot be loaded because running scripts is disabled on this system."
Open PowerShell as Administrator and run:
    Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
Then try your npm or npx command again.
